# ioBroker.surepetcareio
=================

This adapter connects a Sureflap pet door connect to IoBroker.

To use it enter your surepetcare.io website or Sureflap Connect app credentials on the settings page.

Currently this only supports one household and one pet door in that household. I have had no time to
do anything else.

The adapter creates one data-point under its instance for each pet. Name and presence information only.
